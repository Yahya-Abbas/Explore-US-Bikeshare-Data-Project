# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data-Project
Use Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data. Calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

## Description
    In this project, Python 3, Pandas, and Numpy are used to explore data related to bike sharing systems in three major cities in US: Chicago, New York, and Washington.
    The project answers questions about descriptive statistics for this data. 
    Using an interactive interface, the user chooses the city he is interested in and specifies some parameters by which he may wish to filter the data.
